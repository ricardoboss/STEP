# The STEP Programming Language

## Introduction

STEP is a programming language that is designed to be easy to learn and use.

It is inspired by languages like Python, JavaScript, Dart and C#.

## Features

- **Easy to learn and use** — It has a simple syntax and a small set of features.
- **Statically typed** — Declare the type of a variable before you can use it.
- **Interpreted** — No need to compile your code before you can run it.
- **Cross-platform** — Run it on Windows, Linux and macOS.
- **Open source** — Contribute to the language and its ecosystem.
- **Extensible** — Write your own functions and libraries and import them anywhere.

## Installation

To use STEP, you need to set up the STEP CLI.

Check out the [installation guide](https://github.com/ricardoboss/STEP/wiki/Command-Line-Interface) for more information.

## Documentation

To get started using STEP, head over to the [Guide](https://github.com/ricardoboss/STEP/wiki/Guide).

STEP has a standard framework of functions you can use in your programs.
An overview of all functions can be found in the [Functions](https://github.com/ricardoboss/STEP/wiki/Function) section of the wiki.

Additionally, STEP has very graceful error handling.
All errors are documented in the [Errors](https://github.com/ricardoboss/STEP/wiki/Errors) section of the wiki.

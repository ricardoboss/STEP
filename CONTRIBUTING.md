## Code of Conduct

Please read and adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to ensure a positive and inclusive environment for
all contributors.

## Getting Started

### Forking the Repository

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<username>/STEP.git
   ```

### Setting Up Your Local Environment

1. Install [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
   ```bash
   dotnet --info
   ```
   The output should list an SDK version that starts with `9.`.
2. Restore the dependencies and build once to make sure everything compiles:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   dotnet build --configuration Debug
   ```
3. (optional) Get an IDE and set it up
    - [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)
    - [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
4. Open your cloned repository

## Making Changes

### Creating a Feature Branch

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
   ```bash
   # if an issue you want to fix exists, use issues/<id>-<description>:
   git checkout -b issues/26-contribution-docs
   
   # if no issue exists or is not applicable, choose an appropriate category and give it a short description:
   git checkout -b meta/change-project-name
   # or:
   git checkout -b workflow/add-build-scripts
   ```
2. Commit your changes
    - Make sure your changes are not out-of-scope for the issue you are working on
    - Create small commits and put the idea behind each change in the commit message

3. Write tests
    - To add integration tests:
        - create a new file in the `StepLang/Examples` folder
        - Add a file with the same name and the extension `.step.out` with the expected output in the
          `StepLang.Tests/Examples` folder
    - To add unit tests, create new Xunit tests in the appropriate `StepLang.Tests` folder

4. Document your changes
    - Add a concise, human-readable bullet point under the `# Unreleased` heading in `CHANGELOG.md` summarizing your
      contribution.
    - If your change affects multiple areas, group related updates into a single entry where possible.

### Coding Guidelines

Make sure your code is properly formatted and follows our coding guidelines:

- Format your code using `dotnet format`
- Follow
  the [C# Coding Conventions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)
- Follow the [.NET Design Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/)

### Verify your changes

Before opening a pull request, make sure the changelog is updated and the automated checks pass locally:

```bash
dotnet format --verify-no-changes
dotnet test --configuration Test
dotnet run --project ./StepLang.CLI/StepLang.CLI.csproj -- --version
```

If you want to try a sample program, run one of the files in `StepLang/Examples/`. Expected inputs and outputs are
mirrored in `StepLang.Tests/Examples/` as `.step.in` / `.step.out` fixtures:

```bash
dotnet run --project ./StepLang.CLI/StepLang.CLI.csproj -- StepLang/Examples/assignment.step
```

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Commit and push your changes to your forked repository.
2. Ensure your Pull Request description calls out the new `CHANGELOG.md` entry so reviewers can verify it quickly.
3. Create a Pull Request from your branch to the main repository's `main` branch.
4. Provide a clear description of your changes and the problem it solves.

# Welcome 👋

STEP is a programming language that is designed to be easy to learn and use.

It is inspired by languages like Python, JavaScript, Dart and C#.

## Features

- **Easy to learn and use** — It has a simple syntax and a small set of features.
- **Statically typed** — You need to declare the type of a variable before you can use it.
- **Interpreted** — You don't need to compile your code before you can run it.
- **Cross-platform** — You can run it on Windows, Linux and macOS.
- **Open source** — You can contribute to the language and its ecosystem.
- **Extensible** — You can write your own functions and libraries and import them anywhere.

## Installation

To use STEP, you need to set up the STEP CLI.

# Imported File Does Not Exist Exception

## Description

The file that is being imported does not exist.

Example:

Suppose we have the following file structure:

```
main.step
lib/
	lib.step
	foo/
		bar.step
```

If `main.step` contains the following line:

```step
import "lib.step"
```

Then this error will be thrown because `lib.step` is not in the same directory as `main.step`.

## Remediation

Check the file path and ensure that the file exists.
The given path must be relative to the file importing it.

Example:

From `main.step` we'd have to import `lib/lib.step` like so:

```step
import "lib/lib.step"
```

And `bar.step` like this:

```step
import "lib/foo/bar.step"
```

If `lib.step` were to import `bar.step` it would have to do so like this:

```step
import "foo/bar.step"
```

This is because `lib.step` is in the same directory as the `foo` directory.

# Imported File Is Self Exception

## Description

The imported file is the same as the file that is importing it.

Example:

Suppose we have a file named `hello.step` with the following content:

```step
import "hello.step"
```

Then the file would try to import itself, which is not allowed.

## Remediation

Remove the import statement from the file or make sure the correct file is imported.

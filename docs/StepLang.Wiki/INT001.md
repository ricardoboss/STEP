# Undefined Identifier Exception

## Description

This exception is thrown when an identifier is used that was not previously defined or not defined in the current scope.

Example:

```step
number a = b + 1
```

or:

```step
if (true) {
	number a = b + 1
}

number b = 2
```

## Remediation

Make sure that the identifier is defined in the current scope or in a parent scope and before it is used.

```diff
+ number b = 1
  number a = b + 1
```

or:

```diff
+ number b = 2

  if (true) {
  	number a = b + 1
  }

- number b = 2
```

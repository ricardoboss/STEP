# Unexpected End Of Tokens Exception

## Description

The parser has reached the end of the token stream before it expected to.
This is usually caused by a missing token or a missing closing token.

Example:

```step
if (true) {
	print("Hello, World!")
```

## Remediation

Check the syntax of the code and ensure that all tokens are present and that all opening tokens have a corresponding
closing token.

```diff
  if (true) {
  	print("Hello, World!")
+ }
```

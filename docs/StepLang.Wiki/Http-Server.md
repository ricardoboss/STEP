# HTTP Server

STEP has the ability to serve HTTP requests.
This can be used for creating websites and toying around with web technologies.

## "Hello World" Server

This script will start a server on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and respond to all requests with
"Hello World":

```step
httpServer(8080, (map request) {
	return "Hello World"
})
```

The call to `httpServer` is blocking, meaning any code after it is not executed.

You can also pass an existing function:

```step
function handleRequest = (map request) {
	return "Hello World"
}

httpServer(8080, handleRequest)
```

## Serving Files

This script will start a server on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and serve files from the current
directory. It will also serve `index.html` when the user requests `/`:

```step
httpServer(8080, (map request) {
	if (!startsWith(request["path"], "/")) {
		request["path"] = "/" + request["path"]
	}

	if (request["path"] == "/") {
		request["path"] = "/index.html"
	}

	string file = "." + request["path"]
	if (fileExists(file)) {
		return fileResponse(file)
	}

	return {"body": "404 Not Found", "status": 404}
})
```

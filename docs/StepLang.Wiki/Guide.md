# Your first STEP program

> **Note**  
> Make sure you have set up the [STEP CLI](./Command-Line-Interface) before you continue.

## 1. Create a new file

Create a new text file in a folder of your choice and call it `hello.step`.

You can do this with a text editor, for example [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## 2. Write your first program

In the file you created, write the following code:

```step
println("Hello, world!")
```

## 3. Run your program

To run this program, you need to open a terminal in the folder where you created the file.

Then, you can run the following command:

```bash
step hello.step
```

This will run your program and print `Hello, world!` to the terminal.

## Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

You have just written and run your first STEP program!

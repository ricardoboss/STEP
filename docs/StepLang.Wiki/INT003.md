# Invalid Expression Type Exception

## Description

A different kind of expression was expected.
Certain functions only accept certain types of expressions (for example: `typename` only accepts variables, not
constant or mathematical expressions).

## Example

```step
typename(1)
```

## Remediation

Make sure the expression is of the correct type.

```diff
- typename(1)
+ number a = 1
+ typename(a)
```

# "I got an error"

Sometimes while programming, you will get an error.
This is normal.
It is a part of the process of developing software.
Errors are a great opportunity to learn new things.

The first step when you get an error is to carefully read it.
Most errors describe the problem really well, even if you don't understand them at first.

Follow these general steps to solve an error:

1. Read the error message carefully.
2. Look for issues at the line number where the error occurred.
    - Check that you have not made any typos.
    - Check that you have not forgotten any punctuation.
    - Check the placement of your parentheses (`(` and `)`), brackets (`[` and `]`), and braces (`{` and `}`).
    - Also check the lines before and after the erroring line.
3. Try to rewrite this part of the code in a different way.
4. If you still can't solve the error, ask others for help on the [Discord server].

# "My code behaves unexpectedly"

If you don't understand why your code behaves in a certain way, try these steps to help debug your code:

1. Add `println()` statements to your code to see what values your variables have at certain points.
2. Try to reproduce the problem in a smaller program.
3. Share your code with others and ask them for help on the [Discord server].

# Index Out Of Bounds Exception

## Description

The index of a list or string was out of bounds.

## Example

```step
list a = [1, 2, 3]
println(a[3])
```

## Remediation

Make sure the index is within the bounds of the list or string (0 to length - 1).

```diff
  list a = [1, 2, 3]
- println(a[3])
+ println(a[2])
```

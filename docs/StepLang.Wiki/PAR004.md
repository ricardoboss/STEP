# Invalid Index Operator Exception

## Description

This error occurs when the index operator is used on a type that does not support it.

Example:

```step
number a = 1

println(a[0])
```

## Remediation

Ensure that the type supports the index operator.

```diff
- number a = 1
+ string a = "1"

  println(a[0])
```

or

```diff
- number a = 1
+ list a = [1]

  println(a[0])
```

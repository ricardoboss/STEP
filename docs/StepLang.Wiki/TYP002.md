# Incompatible Expression Operands Exception

## Description

The operands of an expression are incompatible.

Example:

```step
number a = 1 - "string"
```

or:

```step
println(-"string")
```

## Remediation

Check the operands of the expression and make sure they can be used with the operator you are using.

```diff
- number a = 1 - "string"
+ number a = 1 - 2
```

or:

```diff
- number a = 1 - "string"
+ string a = 1 + "string"
```

or:

```diff
- println(-"string")
+ println(-1)
```

or:

```diff
- println(-"string")
+ println(-1.0)
```

  in https://github.com/ricardoboss/STEP/pull/109
    * Added "parse" command to show the parsed abstract syntax tree
    * All variable declarations now support the nullability indicator (`?`)

    * `break` and `continue` no longer allow expressions to break/continue for multiple loops
    * Exceptions that were previously printed with the affected code can now also show the causing token
    * Native functions now support union types to accept more than one value type of parameter
* Added `httpServer` and `fileResponse` functions by @ricardoboss in https://github.com/ricardoboss/STEP/pull/112
    * Also classify `fetch` as a web function together with `httpServer` and `fileResponse`
* New functions:
    * `indexOf`

      in https://github.com/ricardoboss/STEP/commit/d64468b6ce9e8b2efb3dffddc73bc12ddb9c3dec
    * `split` by @ricardoboss in https://github.com/ricardoboss/STEP/pull/115
* `print` and `println` now flush to the output directly after being called
* loop constructs allow truthy values to continue looping (as opposed to only boolean values)
* Many bug fixes, including:
    * Loops new properly handle `break` and `continue` statements
    * Loop bodies now better keep track of their own scope
    * Fix conversion of map result to expression node by wrapping keys in quotes before passing them as values to

* Logical operators now short-circuit
    * This also enables "bash-style" expressions like `true && "it's true"` evaluating to `"it's true"`
* Added support for variable length separators in split function and made length parameter of substring optional by
  @ricardoboss in https://github.com/ricardoboss/STEP/commit/d56458eee4919d65ff4ed410d0a3edfe4d3b509d
